CLI Interface:

+ Output of program is now a folder containing the png/jpg QR Codes and a html file which displays the QR Codes in a print friendly manner
|----Optionally output codes as pdf instead (requires weasyprint)
+ Added JPEG as output option
+ (need to implement) No longer allowed to output png and jpg and b64 at the same time
+ (need to implement) pipe interface
+ (need to implement) better error messages
+ (need to implement) minimum split requirement based on key size

Internally:

+ rename `write_chunks_png` to `write_chunks` and allow passing a pillow supported image extension instead
+ `write_chunks`, and `write_chunks_b64` now return a tuple of relative filepaths to the QR code images created
+ added `create_html_file` function for creating html file with QR codes placed nicely
+ added `create_pdf_file` function for creating pdf from html file (requires weasyprint)
+ (need to implement) broken into modules
